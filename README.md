<!-- I am teaching myself* python. This is my first attempt at programming anything since myspace.com. ANY advice, input, critique, or hatemail is welcomed @ theoriginalashketchum@protonmail.com -->

### Alexander is a language learning tool designed for any skil level.

Translate languages, search wikipedia in other languages, or search google in your browsers defined region(s), and learn to pronounce words from native speakers through the speech module.

Future updates include a system for highlighting Nouns, Verbs, and the like as well as scroll over definitions and more.

***Note: You will have to install tkinter on your own, on Ubuntu this is done by running "sudo apt install python3-tk."***

***Included is .Run.py, which is a .zip of all the .py files in .Alexander converted into a .py file (You can also extract the original .py files by opening .Run.py in your archive manager). You can delete the .py files and call Alexander by running the command "python .Alexander/.Run.py" to save space***
